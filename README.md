What is One-Hot-Encoding? 
One hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors. This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values. Then, each integer value is represented as a binary vector that is all zero values except the index of the integer, which is marked with a 1.

This project has 2 parts.
1. Recommendations by one hot encoding of the directors of various movies.
2. Recommendations by one hot encoding of the movie names.
