What is One-Hot-Encoding? 
One hot encoding is a representation of categorical variables as binary vectors. This first requires that the categorical values be mapped to integer values. Then, each integer value is represented as a binary vector that is all zero values except the index of the integer, which is marked with a 1.

This project recommends the top 10 movies based on the directors of the movie the user tells.
